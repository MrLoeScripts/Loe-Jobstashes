# Loe-Jobstashes
Loe-JobStashes is a FiveM QBCore script that provides job-specific storage for players, allowing them to store and retrieve items based on their role. It integrates with qb-target for easy interaction with stash zones. The script is fully configurable, allowing custom stash sizes, slots, and job-based access restrictions for enhanced roleplay.
